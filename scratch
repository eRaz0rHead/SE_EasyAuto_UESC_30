 You are now piloting The Calescent  -- a Wayfarer class exploration vessel.  
 
 The Calescent features a Class B Helios Gravity Drive for primary propulsion. 
 
 The Helios responds to standard piloting control without specialized training.  
 NOTE: Maximum Acceleration is only achieved with Inertial Dampeners OFF.  
  
 A small number of attitude ions provide limited additional propulsion. 
  
 Piloting this vessel inside other gravity fields ( natural or artificial ) is not advisable.
