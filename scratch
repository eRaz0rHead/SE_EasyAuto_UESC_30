   You are now piloting The Calescent   
                 -- a Wayfarer class exploration vessel.   
 
  The Calescent features a Class B Helios Gravity Drive 
  The Helios responds to standard piloting controls  
       (No specialized training required) 
  NOTE: Maximum Acceleration is only achieved with 
         Inertial Dampeners OFF.  
   Attitude ions provide limited additional propulsion.  
   Piloting this vessel inside other gravity fields is not advised. "
