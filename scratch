  The Calescent features a Class B Helios Gravity Drive  
  The Helios responds to standard piloting controls   
       (No specialized training required)  
  NOTE: Maximum Acceleration is only achieved with  
         Inertial Dampeners OFF.   
   Attitude ions provide limited additional propulsion.   
   Piloting this vessel inside other gravity fields is not advised. "
