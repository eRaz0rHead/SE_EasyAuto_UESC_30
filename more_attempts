 You are now piloting The Calescent  -- a Wayfarer class exploration vessel. 

 The Calescent features a Class B Helios Gravity Drive for primary propulsion.

 The Helios responds to standard piloting control without specialized training. 
 NOTE: Maximum Acceleration is only achieved with Inertial Dampeners OFF. 
 
 A small number of attitude ions provide limited additional propulsion.
 
 Piloting this vessel inside other gravity fields ( natural or artificial ) is not advisable.
